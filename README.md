# Matrix Multiplication
a - Standard inner product based row-col multiplication algorithm. (sourcecode = S1, result = M1, Time taken = T1)
b - O(n^3) Divide-n-Conquer strategy-based multiplication algorithm. (sourcecode = S2, result = M2, Time taken = T2)
c - Strassen's recursive divide-n-conquer strategy-based algorithm. (sourcecode = S3, result = M3, Time taken = T3)
d - Parallelize O(n^3) Divide-n-Conquer strategy-based multiplication algorithm. (sourcecode = S4, result = M4, Time taken = T4)
e - Parallelize Strassen's recursive divide-n-conquer strategy-based algorithm. (sourcecode = S5, result = M5, Time taken = T5)
